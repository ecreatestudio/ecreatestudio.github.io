        <h1>Privacy Policy - eCreate Studio</h1>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
          collected, used, and shared when you visit ecreate.studio (the
          “Site”).
        </p>

        <p>
          PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT <br />When you visit the Site, we
          automatically collect certain information about your device, including
          information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of
          the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you
          browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages
          or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you
          to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We
          refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
          Information”.
        </p>

        <p>
          We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
          <br />- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or
          computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more
          information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
          http://www.allaboutcookies.org. <br />- “Log files” track actions
          occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
          browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
          date/time stamps. <br />- “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are
          electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
          Site.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we
          are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.
        </p>

        <p>
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating
          analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site,
          and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
        </p>

        <p>
          SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION <br />We share your Personal
          Information with third parties to help us use your Personal
          Information, as described above. For example, we also use Google
          Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site -- you
          can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:

          of Google Analytics 41here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
          applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
          warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to
          otherwise protect our rights.
        </p>

        <p>
          BEHAVIOURAL ADVERTISING <br />As described above, we use your Personal

          communications we believe may be of interest to you. For more
          information about how targeted advertising works, you can visit the
